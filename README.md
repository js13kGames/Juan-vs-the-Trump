# Juan vs. The Trump

Desktop entry for the [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com) 2015 competition.

Our hero is Juan. His desires in life are simple: collect coins and stay alive.
His lifelong rival is the Trump, who just likes to screw everything up.

Help Juan navigate the floating platforms to collect coins. But be careful: some
platforms have deadly spikes and the Trump shows up every so often to scare you
and reverse the direction of the platforms.

**Controls**: Left/Right arrows to move, Spacebar to jump
